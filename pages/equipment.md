## <a class="anchor" name="Mobile Digitization Kit: Scanning Kit List"></a>Mobile Digitization Kit: Scanning Kit List
The Scanning Kit was our mobile digitization kit used for scanning two-dimensional material and films and negatives. It was used at our community digitization events and in our work with cultural heritage institutions.


The standard Scanning Kit was made up of an Epson V600 flatbed scanner and a laptop. The scanner was transported in a wheeled hard protector case, with the laptop and other supplies transported in a backpack. The Epson V800, a larger model in the Epson V scanner series, was purchased for one of the community kits. It had added functionality over the V600, however, ultimately we decided this scanner was too large and heavy to truly be considered ‘mobile’ so we did not include it in the list of recommended equipment.

The Scanning Kit List comprises everything that makes up the kit. It is split into two sections, with a minimum and maximum price range. We purchased everything in the two sections, however we made some items optional to differentiate between what we believe are required items for the kit and items that can be purchased depending on budget considerations and/or that may already be in hand.

## <a class="anchor" name="Mobile Digitization Kit: Copy Stand Kit List"></a>Mobile Digitization Kit: Copy Stand Kit List
The Copy Stand Kit was our mobile digitization kit used to digitize oversize two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. We used the kit in our community events and in our work with cultural heritage institutions. However, as the project progressed we found that using the copy stand at community events was not efficient in the fast-paced workflow of an event. The lighting environment could not be controlled in a community event setting either, which lowered the quality of the images.


The kit comprised of a Canon Rebel T5 DSLR camera, a tripod that could invert, a photographic backdrop, studio quality lights and a laptop. The camera and lights were transported in a wheeled hard protector case, with the laptop, tripod and backdrop and other supplies loaded into a backpack.

This kit was used exclusively at our community scanning events, in a move towards interactive community events. The kit comprised of a tablet that was used to create a slideshow of historic materials relevant to the neighborhood the event was being held in and another tablet with headphones that was used as an oral history listening station.

## <a class="anchor" name="Culture in Transit: Master Equipment Inventory"></a>Culture in Transit: Master Equipment Inventory
We developed a master equipment inventory to track every piece of equipment we considered for our mobile digitization kits. The inventory contains every item we purchased for our kits, with details on which kit the equipment was used in, the product ID, cost (as at March 2016), where we bought it from and any comments about the item.
