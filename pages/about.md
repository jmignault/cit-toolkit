<br/>
This toolkit is an outcome of the [Culture in Transit](http://www.mnylc.org/cit/) project. It is intended to serve as a resource for other organizations interested in initiating mobile digitization services. All or parts of the toolkit can be used and adapted as needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Included in the toolkit are resources for organizing and executing community engagement events; implementing and offering a mobile digitization service to small cultural institutions; and providing advice, comment and considerations on equipment used for digitization, with emphasis on mobile digitization kits.

## <a name="About Culture in Transit"></a>About Culture in Transit
<br/>
Culture in Transit was a partnership between the [Metropolitan New York Library Council](http://metro.org/) (METRO), the [Brooklyn Public Library](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/) and [Queens Library](http://www.queenslibrary.org/) to bring mobile scanning equipment to smaller libraries, archives, museums, and the communities they serve. It was one of 22 projects to win the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation’s](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) [Knight News Challenge on Libraries](http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/22-projects-win-knight-news-challenge-libraries) in 2014.
<br/>
<br/>
The work fell into two main areas:
<br/>
<br/>

- Community events (Queens Library and Brooklyn Public Library): Mobile digitization kits were taken to library branches and other community spaces where local residents were invited to bring in family photos and memorabilia. Materials were scanned and returned to donors along with a flash drive of digital copies of their material. The digital copies were included in the libraries’ respective digital catalogs, and shared with the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/).

- Working with small cultural heritage institutions (METRO): Mobile digitization kits were taken to METRO member institutions across New York City and Westchester County to scan selected collections and make them available on METRO’s digital platform, [DCMNY](http://dcmny.org/) and in the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/). The service was designed to assist smaller cultural heritage institutions who had either undertaken none or very little digitization of their collections and who did not have adequate resources to do the work in house.
